Prerequisites for Deployment :

. Verify the MATLAB Compiler Runtime (MCR) is installed and ensure you    
  have installed version 7.17 (R2012a).   

. If the MCR is not installed, do following:
  (1) enter
  
      >>mcrinstaller
      
      at MATLAB prompt. This MCR Installer command displays the 
      location of the MCR Installer.

  (2) run the MCR Installer.

Or download Windows 64bit version of MCR from the MathWorks website:

   http://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/
   
   
For more information about the MCR and the MCR Installer, see 
“Working With the MCR” in the MATLAB Compiler User’s Guide.    


NOTE: You will need administrator rights to run MCRInstaller. 

Steps for running the project:

1. Start by clicking Face_Rec.exe

2. A GUI will open from which select the "Calculate Eigenfaces" button and enter the number of images to use for training(Remember to place the training images in the Matlab work folder.)

3.Each stage of the Training process will be shown just press any button or click mouse anywhere on the screen to continue.

4.Once Training is complete you can select image for recognition from "Recognition Button"

5. "Update Database" can be used to add new images to Database.

6. "Delete database" is used to delete the entire database of Eigenfaces.
